Probabilistic deconvolution of chromatin interaction signal in 3D genome data
======

![Schematic of deconvolution for 3D genome data](/images/decon-fig1.png)

I developed a probabilistic model to describe the convolution of signal in 3D genome
data such as HiChIP and RD-SPRITE. The method leverages DNA-DNA contacts to estimate
the true, deconvolved signal. 


Detection of allele-specific expression in spatial transcriptomics
======

![X-chromosome ASE patterns in Slide-seq](/images/spase.png)

I developed a method to detect allele-specific expression in spatial transcriptomics. The
method uses a beta-binomial likelihood and 2D smoothing splines to model spatial
patterns.
