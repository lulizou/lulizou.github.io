I am currently a Senior Scientist at Genentech. Previously, I was biostatistics 
PhD student and NSF GRFP fellow at Harvard advised by [Martin Aryee](https://www.aryeelab.org/) 
and [Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/). 
My research focused on the development of 
statistical and  computational methods for sparse and spatial genomic data. 
In summer 2022, I was an intern in oncology bioinformatics at Genentech. 
Prior to joining the PhD
program, I was a post-bac fellow at NHGRI with Francis Collins. I double-majored
in statistics and genetics at UW-Madison, and I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
In my spare time, I enjoy doing pilates, watching Wisconsin sports, and playing the 
latest Pokemon game.
